<h3>Avalanche Fundamentals — Virtual Machines Explained!</h3><h4>Learning about the Avalanche Ecosystem — Part III</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ht2WgGu5HHBGbWyUT6Ll9w.png" /></figure><h3>Virtual Machines (VM)</h3><ul><li>Defines the application-level logic</li><li>Specifies the blockchain state and way users can interact</li><li>Consensus and Networking abstracted</li></ul><p>A virtual machine in the context of a blockchain system is like a decentralized computer that can execute a program in a controlled environment. When you build a VM, You don’t need to worry about these lower level logic like networking, consensus and the structure of the blockchain itself. Avalanche does this behind the scenes so you can focus on your specific use case.</p><p>The most popular VM in Blockchain systems is EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine). It is used in the Ethereum blockchain but also many other blockchains such as Avalanche C-Chain, or Polygon. It enables the creation and execution of smart contracts. However, blockchain systems are not limited to the EVM. Many blockchain systems operate with different VMs today.</p><h4>Let’s understand this with the analogy of a soda machine.</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/913/1*QyU6boF5EnzcEt56X3YxbQ.png" /></figure><p>Our machine has a state. In our example, the state may consist of the current balance and the number of cans available per flavor.</p><p>Our machine permits two operations:</p><ul><li>Insert coin</li><li>Select a soda flavor</li></ul><p>Each of the operations we talked about triggers state transition. State transition means that when an operation is performed, the state of the machine changes.</p><p>Ex: When we select a flavor of soda, If the cost of the soda is less than the balance available, we will get soda can, the balance will be reduced by the cost of the soda, and the available value will be reduced by 1.</p><p>So, Implementing these state machines bring several advantages:</p><ol><li>Clear Interface:<br>- Range of operations provide clarity<br>- Interact with all VMs in the same way</li><li>Reproducibility<br>- Create multiple identical instances<br>- Consistence Behavior<br>- Same operations in the same sequence create same state.</li></ol><h4>Let’s now transfer this concept of virtual machines to Blockchain Systems.</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/924/1*B9NlmM6S0LnxSc4vO_e10Q.png" /></figure><p>Each validator in the blockchain system operates their own instance of our hypothetical soda machine or any other virtual machine and this instance is running on our server. This way they don’t need to trust a single party with operation of a soda dispenser and make it easy for everyone to verify the outcome of the operations.</p><p>When a user wishes to execute an operation on the distributed soda machine, they transmit a transaction to the network. If there are many transactions submitted to the network the validators reach consensus on the sequence in which transactions should be out. In Avalanche the validators are using Avalanche consensus.</p><p>And when they agree on the sequence of the transactions, they execute each operation in the same sequence. And this means that because the operations are executed, they keep the same uniform view on the machine state. Which ensures the balance and the number of cans remaining stays the same. i.e. final state of all the machines stay the same.</p><h4>Blockchain</h4><ul><li>Each validator operates VM locally</li><li>Consensus on the order of transactions</li><li>Execute them on their local instance</li><li>Uniform view on the blockchain’s state</li></ul><h4>Variety of VMs</h4><p>Avalanche allows us to have a variety of virtual machines and take this concept further. The same network of validators can run two or more blockchains. These could operate different VMs, like a soda dispenser and a candy dispenser, or identical VMs.</p><p>So a validator, or a set of validators can work on two or more blockchains if they have the additional computational resources required to operate the virtual machines. And when a user wants to issue an operation, they need to specify which blockchain to interact with.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/913/1*myfRCNPPjxKPEf84gvWMjQ.png" /></figure><p>And multi-VM blockchains can be used to create logically independent blockchains. This means that different blockchains can have different states, even though they are using the same VM. This is useful for creating blockchains that have different rules or settings. Like the data to be associated with some user might be different in both the cases.</p><p><strong>Reference: </strong><a href="https://academy.avax.network"><strong>Avalanche Academy</strong></a><strong> and </strong><a href="https://www.google.com"><strong>Google</strong></a><strong><br>Sources: All the illustrations are taken from </strong><a href="https://academy.avax.network"><strong>Avalanche Academy</strong></a></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=2983876fc1e8" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/coinmonks/avalanche-fundamentals-virtual-machines-explained-2983876fc1e8">Avalanche Fundamentals — Virtual Machines Explained!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/coinmonks">Coinmonks</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>
