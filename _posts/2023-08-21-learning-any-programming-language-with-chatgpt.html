<h4>One of the best ways ChatGPT can be used in.</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*0jQ_wB7wd998O3vFdYFrkA.png" /></figure><h3>Why Am I Learning Rust, What Makes Me Write This?</h3><p>As I mentioned in my earlier blog, I’m exploring different things to find something I really love and In the moment I’m actually trying to learn about blockchain. After having a discussion with a friend of mine who has been in blockchain development space for quite a while, he suggested me to go with the Rust Language and her we are, I started learning the Rust language. At the time of writing this blog I already worked on quite a few beginner level Rust programs like the default first program “Hello, World!”, variables, data types, type inference and type annotations, if else and branching, user input, etc. And I don’t think we as programmers will ever get bored of this “Hello, World!” program. Moving on to the Learning Part.</p><h3>What are the basic things you need to learn a Programming Language? or anything new.</h3><ol><li>The Will to Do So (<strong>The Spark of Intent</strong>): Seeing you come so far, I can clearly see the Spark of Intent in you about learning something new.</li><li>Curiosity (<strong>The Inquisitive Catalyst</strong>):<strong> </strong>As programmers we usually are curious about what we can do with do with a particular technology. How it can be used, what problems can be solved using this, what things can be made more efficient, etc.</li><li>Resources Galore<strong> </strong>(<strong>The Learning Arsenal</strong>): Accumulating the different resources (lectures, books, code samples, documentation, etc.) for working our way up learning something.</li><li>A Clear Plan of Action (<strong>The Guiding Blueprint</strong>): One of the most important things. Think of it as, we can’t go making full-fledged market ready products in our first time of writing code in a new language, right? We first need to learn different concepts of the programming language, a bit of experience, etc.</li><li>Practice (<strong>The Refinement Forge</strong>): Last but not the least, something that differentiates the expert from the novice. Knowing everything does keep you in a place above a lot of people, But it can’t take the place of someone who is experienced. Just like Bruce Lee said</li></ol><blockquote>I am not afraid of <strong>a person</strong> who knows 10000 kicks. But I am afraid of a person who knows one kick but practices it for 10000 times.</blockquote><p>For the points 3 and 4, We will be leveraging the power of ChatGPT.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*B86bj3kHuXS4OgovwdDVuA.png" /></figure><h3>Making a Plan of Action — Method I</h3><ol><li>Fire up ChatGPT, and Open a new chat so that this particular chat is used only to learn the language.</li><li>Enter the prompt “Make me a 4 week plan for learning beginner level &lt;your desired programming language&gt;”</li><li>Submit the prompt and you’ll have your answer. Which might look something like this.</li></ol><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*vmp8MMICekwfSODHc3J-dg.png" /></figure><h3>Making a Plan of Action — Method II</h3><ol><li>Fire up Google. Search beginner level books of the language or subject you’re tying to learn.</li><li>Select a book whose table of content is clear, detailed and technical(You won’t need to spend a penny).</li><li>Now that you have the detailed ToC, We will move on to the next part.</li></ol><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/495/1*acLv5Ps_58H2zAdGupgiyA.png" /></figure><h3>Getting the Resources!</h3><p>Fire up ChatGPT again. And Make it teach you the concepts and programming.</p><p>Example 1: <strong>How can I Write A Hello World Program?</strong></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*-hbo5s4XJegKIVGzI38VlA.png" /></figure><p>Now Practice. Make a directory/repository(Whatever you like) for your Rust Codes. And try running your first Rust program.</p><p><strong>Warning: DON’T EVER COPY PASTE. You’ll Never Learn If You Go On Copy Pasting Codes and Assignments, etc from ChatGPT and It’s Yourself You’re Betraying.</strong></p><p>Write your “Hello, World!” program.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/974/1*qStx2XL4Rn4Qu6qOMUg2qg.png" /><figcaption>We wrote our first Rust program.</figcaption></figure><p>Run the program using the command <strong>cargo run</strong></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/974/1*NpFH-VJBFaoom8X-ntABuw.png" /><figcaption>And we successfully ran our first Rust program.</figcaption></figure><p>Example 2: <strong>Teach me about variables and basic data types.</strong></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*qV3LWqiWFunSRRG8F8wn3g.png" /></figure><p>Practice declaring variables and other things.</p><p>And if you’re having a doubt about something let ChatGPT take care of it. For Example, Let’s assume that we don’t know what mutable and immutable is. Actually I too didn’t really knew the meaning of immutable until it showed up in our second year’s course of Python (Tuples, if you know you know).</p><p>Example 3: <strong>What is mutable and immutable?</strong></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Ki3ndnGIqqIcKcYy2ZosUQ.png" /><figcaption>Ask doubts back to ChatGPT for Clarification.</figcaption></figure><p>Be a curious person, and never leave a doubt around.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*meUPpfXc6v5rPBKu2YIRNg.png" /></figure><p>Keep Learning, Keep Hacking, Keep Loving, Stay Happy, Stay Healthy, No Hate and lastly <strong>Good Vibes Only.</strong></p><blockquote>Dear readers,</blockquote><blockquote>I appreciate your time and attention in reading my blog post.
