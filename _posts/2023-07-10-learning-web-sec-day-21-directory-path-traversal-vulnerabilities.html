<h3>Learning Web-Sec — Day 21 — Directory/Path Traversal Vulnerabilities</h3><h4>Part IV — Solving PortSwigger’s Lab 5 and 6 of Directory Traversal</h4><blockquote>In today’s blog, we’ll delve into the Solution and logic of 5th and 6th lab focused on Directory Traversal, offered by PortSwigger’s Academy.</blockquote><h4>Lab 5 — File path traversal, validation of start of path (<a href="https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-path-traversal/lab-validate-start-of-path">Link</a>)</h4><p>Level of Lab: Practitioner</p><p>Description of Lab:</p><blockquote>This lab contains a file path traversal vulnerability in the display of product images.</blockquote><blockquote>The application transmits the full file path via a request parameter, and validates that the supplied path starts with the expected folder.</blockquote><blockquote>To solve the lab, retrieve the contents of the /etc/passwd file.</blockquote><p>1. Access the lab.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1008/1*0ViTcw8klCcD4OAFkWMcpQ.png" /></figure><p>2. Open the Image in a new tab and let’s look at the URL.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*vopFOL1SlrN5fWhWM14PDA.png" /></figure><p>We can see that the URL starts with <strong>/var/www/images</strong>, We can try appending <strong>/../../../etc/passwd</strong> in front of the <strong>images</strong> part of the URL.</p><p>3. It worked. We were successful in performing a Directory Traversal attack.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Z5x7BZiUJE3Amh4XmrRNnA.png" /></figure><p>4. And now we’re done with the lab.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*8sknIE92SWJ-bqD3HkjTcg.png" /></figure><h4>Lab 6 — File path traversal, validation of file extension with null byte bypass (<a href="https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-path-traversal/lab-validate-file-extension-null-byte-bypass">Link</a>)</h4><p>Level of Lab: Practitioner</p><p>Description of Lab:</p><blockquote>This lab contains a file path traversal vulnerability in the display of product images.</blockquote><blockquote>The application validates that the supplied filename ends with the expected file extension.</blockquote><blockquote>To solve the lab, retrieve the contents of the /etc/passwd file.</blockquote><p>1. Access the lab.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*h-28w9enH3aWDASvjs4Jlw.png" /></figure><p>2. Open any image from the webpage in a new tab.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*RckJAsfXcmT2Lri1ZuIytg.png" /></figure><p>Let’s now try appending null character and file extension to the URL.</p><p>3. And we here don’t get a <strong>No such file</strong> error. That means we were successful performing Directory Traversal attack.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Izl_wX3vEGeBlfSm8TUKzw.png" /></figure><p>4. And we’ve solved all the directory traversal labs.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*zjEYn8hnF3BZ6AfFXZruKA.png" /></figure><blockquote>In conclusion, the Directory Traversal Labs Walkthrough Blog provides a comprehensive and insightful exploration of the topic. Throughout the walkthrough, we delved into the fundamentals of directory traversal vulnerabilities, exploring their impact and potential exploitation techniques. The walkthrough showcased real-world scenarios and common attack vectors, enabling readers to develop a solid understanding of the subject matter.</blockquote><blockquote>Dear readers,</blockquote><blockquote>I appreciate your time and attention in reading my blog post.
